To replicate or devleop models more conveniently, the environment file <environment.txt> is provided to install environment directly.  

## Mains  
data: hERG blockade dataset (csv file contains SMILES and class label) for developing models, which can be replaced by your own dataset;  

fpgnn: main components of the model.
